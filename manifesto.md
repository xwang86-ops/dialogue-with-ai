# 🟡Manifesto 1.0
### During the winter break, upon returning home, my grandmother made me my favorite dish — pork rib and lotus root soup. It’s a classic taste from my hometown in Hubei, where the land is nourished by abundant waters and lotus roots grow endlessly. Since childhood, the flavor of my grandmother’s cooking has accompanied me through the years, etched deeply into my memory. Yet this time, I keenly sensed that the taste of the soup had changed. I suddenly realized that at eighty years old, my grandmother’s memory is fading with time — even the muscle memory of cooking, once instinctive, is beginning to erode. The “taste of home” I remembered is gradually dissolving along with her forgetting.
### This taste cannot be captured by language; it is an embodied memory, deeply rooted in perception and emotion. It led me to wonder: could AI ever become an extension of the human mind, capable of preserving memories that cannot be physically stored? Could it help us articulate those ineffable bodily sensations and emotional currents?
### This reflection reminded me of earlier research: modern society generally believes that the human sense of smell is undergoing irreversible decline, accompanied by a loss in our linguistic ability to describe scents. Yet such conclusions are mostly drawn from “WEIRD” populations — Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. In contrast, among less industrialized groups such as the Maniq and Jahai peoples of Southeast Asia, complex olfactory vocabularies still thrive and guide daily life.
### As a sensory experience that remains largely “undigitized,” smell has been marginalized in our visually dominated, information-driven era. The suppression of non-visual senses and the exclusion of non-dominant communities have created deep epistemic biases. In an ideal world, even in the face of structural limitations, I hope that future AI systems can grow more inclusive — embracing the people, perceptions, memories, and emotions that have long been left outside the arc of technological evolution.

## 🔹logical space
### “The fact is in logical space the existence of states of affairs.”——Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico‑Philosophicus
Our language is a sequence of symbols arranged in a before-and-after order. When it is written down, time is transformed into spatiality, and when it is read, that spatiality is converted back into temporality. Therefore, our existing forms of language are fixed within time; spacetime is the very precondition of their existence.
## 🔹enbedding space
#### LLM: Large Language Models generate text probabilistically，a token's position in embedding space encodes its relationships within semantic space.

### In my Manifesto 1, I envisioned future AI becoming more inclusive—embracing those excluded people, perceptions, memories, and emotions. I refine this vision here by focusing on the linguistic encoding of smell: contrasting Wittgenstein's logical space with the embedding space of large language models, we can understand smell as a "compressed logical space," and olfactory aphasia as the "loss of a language game." This stems from sociopolitical power dynamics—where statistically dominant languages and senses prevail—biases that extend into AI training data. In Manifesto 2, I propose countering this compression by reintroducing smell-description into language games.

**STEP**
🔹Iuput the description of pork rib and lotus root soup in the manifesto 1.0.
🔹Ask ChatGPT enrich the paragraph’s descriptions of sensory details (such as smell and flavor).
🔹Ask ChatGPT reduce descriptions of other aspects of the dish (such as its appearance, ingredients, or origin).
🔹Repeat the above steps until the paragraph contains only descriptions of the dish’s smell.
🔹Refine and condense the description of the dish’s smell to no more than 30 tokens.
🔹Start a new round of conversation to test whether ChatGPT can identify the dish based on this smell description. If it cannot, return to step one and start over.

# 🟡Manifesto 2.1_Study the ways smells are described across different languages, industries, and vocabularies.
## 🔹Austroasiatic-Aslian-Maniq & Jahai
Maniq and Jahai languages have a rare and rich system of abstract olfactory vocabulary in the world. These words do not describe smells based on specific objects (such as "like banana"), but rather describe the abstract qualities of smells, often closely related to ecological perception in their hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

Jahai Language Olfactory Vocabulary Examples
Jahai has about 12 dedicated olfactory verbs (or stative verbs) used to describe a wide range of smell sources. Here are typical examples (phonetic transcription simplified to standard orthography, meanings based on field research):
cŋəs / cŋɛs: Gasoline, smoke, bat guano and bat caves, certain millipedes, wild ginger roots.
ltpɨt / tpɨt: Certain ripe fruits and flowers, durian, pandan, soap, perfume.
pʔus: Musty smell, like spoiled food, mushrooms, old dwellings.
cŋəs (another usage): Sweet smell, like flowers.
Unnumbered but typical: Directly fire-roasted food (often meat, like BBQ); pungent smell (irritates throat, causes tears); rotten smell; damp and moldy smell; fresh blood vs. old blood.

Maniq Language Olfactory Vocabulary Examples
Maniq has at least 15 abstract olfactory expressions, including nouns and stative verbs, structured in two dimensions: pleasantness and danger level, often not limited to single sources. Here are some examples (specific words are less publicly listed, but research confirms their abstract nature):
hamis: Sun smell, also referring to air under sunlight or smoke (prototype as a dangerous smell).
Unnamed but typical: Wild yams, mushrooms, water, soil, boiled yam mud, dirty clothes, rotten bamboo, beans, sweat, urine, old sheds smell categories.
Overall feature: Such as "edible things smell" or "pleasant things smell," which can cover multiple sources like rotten wood, mushrooms, or soil.

## 🔹Sissel Tolaas-NASALO
Sissel Tolaas is a Norwegian artist, chemist, and olfactory researcher. In her RE_search Lab in Berlin, she developed "An Alphabet for the Nose," an objective classification system based on a 7000+ smell archive, from which she derived the fictional olfactory language NASALO to replace subjective metaphors like "smells like ××" with unbiased fantasy words.

NASALO is a "smell alphabet" created by Tolaas after 20 years of experiments, with labels based on objective data like molecular structure and volatility, avoiding "good/bad" dichotomies. Each word is an original fantasy combination (e.g., consonant clusters), and experiments show labels directly influence perception (e.g., a "cheese" label makes body odor more pleasant).

## 🔹Chinese
Chinese language has moderate to low capabilities in describing smells, primarily relying on concrete metaphors and binary oppositions, lacking an abstract dedicated vocabulary system.
·Vocabulary Characteristics
Chinese smell words are mainly source-oriented, categorized into two major dimensions:
Food-related: Fruit scents (banana, watermelon), food and drinks (cake, milk), meal seasonings (fishy, stinky tofu, soy sauce, vinegar).
Non-food-related: Plant and flower scents (tea, mint, jasmine), man-made objects (gasoline, leather, cigarette, disinfectant), natural objects (earth).
Core specific words are limited: fragrant/foul (binary), fishy (fish/shrimp), gamey (mutton), urinous (urine/fox), musty (damp rot), burnt (scorching).
·Semantic and Perceptual Organization
Semantic space: Organized by "food-related/non-food-related" and "man-made/natural" axes, prototype-driven (e.g., fruit scents cluster as sweet fragrance).
Perceptual dimensions: Pleasantness + intensity, divided into sweet-fragrant, disliked, and repulsive smells, but classification consistency is less precise than color terms.
Metaphorical extension: "Flavor" (gunpowder flavor = tension) borrows smell to metaphorize abstract traits.

Compared to Jahai/Maniq's 12+ abstract smell words or NASALO's objective labels, Chinese is more poetic but less precise, suited for literary layering (e.g., "fermented tofu broth's subtle mustiness"), reflecting agricultural culture's prioritization of vision/taste.

## 🔹perfumery, coffee, and wine industries
use specialized Flavor/Perfumery Wheels and layered fragrance systems to transform complex olfactory experiences into standardized, multidimensional language. The Flavor/Perfumery Wheel serves as an industry-standard circular classification tool for scents, emphasizing continuous transitions and family relationships between fragrance families. In contrast, the Fragrance Pyramid (layered fragrance system) is a pyramid structure built on temporal volatility, describing the evolution of a single perfume's scent over time.

Professional scent wheels and fragrance pyramid systems have limitations, mainly in positive bias (favoring pleasant smells), cultural narrowness, and lack of abstraction, failing to cover the full spectrum of everyday smells.
