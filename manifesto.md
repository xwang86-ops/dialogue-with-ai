# 🟡Manifesto 1.0
### During the winter break, upon returning home, my grandmother made me my favorite dish — pork rib and lotus root soup. It’s a classic taste from my hometown in Hubei, where the land is nourished by abundant waters and lotus roots grow endlessly. Since childhood, the flavor of my grandmother’s cooking has accompanied me through the years, etched deeply into my memory. Yet this time, I keenly sensed that the taste of the soup had changed. I suddenly realized that at eighty years old, my grandmother’s memory is fading with time — even the muscle memory of cooking, once instinctive, is beginning to erode. The “taste of home” I remembered is gradually dissolving along with her forgetting.
### This taste cannot be captured by language; it is an embodied memory, deeply rooted in perception and emotion. It led me to wonder: could AI ever become an extension of the human mind, capable of preserving memories that cannot be physically stored? Could it help us articulate those ineffable bodily sensations and emotional currents?
### This reflection reminded me of earlier research: modern society generally believes that the human sense of smell is undergoing irreversible decline, accompanied by a loss in our linguistic ability to describe scents. Yet such conclusions are mostly drawn from “WEIRD” populations — Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. In contrast, among less industrialized groups such as the Maniq and Jahai peoples of Southeast Asia, complex olfactory vocabularies still thrive and guide daily life.
### As a sensory experience that remains largely “undigitized,” smell has been marginalized in our visually dominated, information-driven era. The suppression of non-visual senses and the exclusion of non-dominant communities have created deep epistemic biases. In an ideal world, even in the face of structural limitations, I hope that future AI systems can grow more inclusive — embracing the people, perceptions, memories, and emotions that have long been left outside the arc of technological evolution.

## 🔹logical space
### “The fact is in logical space the existence of states of affairs.”——Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico‑Philosophicus
Our language is a sequence of symbols arranged in a before-and-after order. When it is written down, time is transformed into spatiality, and when it is read, that spatiality is converted back into temporality. Therefore, our existing forms of language are fixed within time; spacetime is the very precondition of their existence.
## 🔹enbedding space
#### LLM: Large Language Models generate text probabilistically，a token's position in embedding space encodes its relationships within semantic space.

### In my Manifesto 1, I envisioned future AI becoming more inclusive—embracing those excluded people, perceptions, memories, and emotions. I refine this vision here by focusing on the linguistic encoding of smell: contrasting Wittgenstein's logical space with the embedding space of large language models, we can understand smell as a "compressed logical space," and olfactory aphasia as the "loss of a language game." This stems from sociopolitical power dynamics—where statistically dominant languages and senses prevail—biases that extend into AI training data. In Manifesto 2, I propose countering this compression by reintroducing smell-description into language games.

**STEP**
🔹Iuput the description of pork rib and lotus root soup in the manifesto 1.0.
🔹Ask ChatGPT enrich the paragraph’s descriptions of sensory details (such as smell and flavor).
🔹Ask ChatGPT reduce descriptions of other aspects of the dish (such as its appearance, ingredients, or origin).
🔹Repeat the above steps until the paragraph contains only descriptions of the dish’s smell.
🔹Refine and condense the description of the dish’s smell to no more than 30 tokens.
🔹Start a new round of conversation to test whether ChatGPT can identify the dish based on this smell description. If it cannot, return to step one and start over.
