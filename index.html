      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>This site explores how smell—the most personal and emotional of our senses—shapes memory, identity, and meaning-making. Drawing from research on olfactory language across cultures, we foreground the sounds and sensations that describe what we smell, and what gets lost when those descriptions fade away.</p>

      <h2>Manifesto (excerpt)</h2>
        <p><strong>🟡 Manifesto 1.0</strong></p>
        <p>During the winter break, upon returning home, my grandmother made me my favorite dish — pork rib and lotus root soup. It's a classic taste from my hometown in Hubei, where the land is nourished by abundant waters and lotus roots grow endlessly. Since childhood, the flavor of my grandmother's cooking has accompanied me through the years, etched deeply into my memory. Yet this time, I keenly sensed that the taste of the soup had changed.</p>
        
        <p>This taste cannot be captured by language; it is an embodied memory, deeply rooted in perception and emotion. It led me to wonder: could AI ever become an extension of the human mind, capable of preserving memories that cannot be physically stored? Could it help us articulate those ineffable bodily sensations and emotional currents?</p>
        
        <p>As a sensory experience that remains largely "undigitized," smell has been marginalized in our visually dominated, information-driven era. The suppression of non-visual senses and the exclusion of non-dominant communities have created deep epistemic biases. In an ideal world, I hope that future AI systems can grow more inclusive — embracing the people, perceptions, memories, and emotions that have long been left outside the arc of technological evolution.</p>

      <h2>Smell Snippets</h2>
      <p>Refined olfactory descriptions — sensory-first vocabulary:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sweet-brothy pork, warm lotus, slow bone musk, faint ginger.</li>
        <li>Green citrus peel, wet soil, crushed basil, bright sap.</li>
        <li>Dry cedar, tobacco-leaf sweetness, sun-warmed resin, dusty spice.</li>

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>This site is based on research into how different languages and cultures encode smell—from the rich olfactory vocabularies of Southeast Asian communities like the Jahai and Maniq peoples, to the sensory language losing ground in industrialized societies. Explore how smell-based language games can help us recover and preserve these irreplaceable dimensions of human perception.</p>
