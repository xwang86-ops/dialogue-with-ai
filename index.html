      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>This site explores how smell—the most personal and emotional of our senses—shapes memory, identity, and meaning-making. Drawing from research on olfactory language across cultures, we foreground the sounds and sensations that describe what we smell, and what gets lost when those descriptions fade away.</p>

          <p><strong>🟡 Manifesto 1.0</strong></p>
          <p>During a winter break, my grandmother made my favorite dish — pork rib and lotus root soup. It is a classic taste from my hometown in Hubei, carried through my childhood and deeply etched into memory. At eighty, my grandmother's memory is fading; even the muscle memory of cooking is eroding. The "taste of home" I remember is slowly dissolving with her forgetting.</p>
          <p>This taste resists easy description; it is an embodied memory rooted in perception and emotion. It raised a question: could AI become an extension of the human mind, preserving memories that cannot be physically stored? Could it help articulate those ineffable bodily sensations and emotional currents?</p>

          <p><strong>Manifesto 2.0</strong></p>
          <p>Contemporary research often concludes that olfactory language is declining, but much of that evidence comes from WEIRD populations. In contrast, less industrialized groups like the Maniq and Jahai retain complex, abstract olfactory vocabularies that guide daily life. Smell, as an as-yet "undigitized" sense, has been marginalized in our visually dominated information society. The suppression of non-visual senses and exclusion of non-dominant communities creates deep epistemic biases. Manifesto 2.0 proposes reintroducing smell-description into language games so AI can become more inclusive of people, perceptions, memories, and emotions traditionally left out.</p>
        </div>
        <p>As a sensory experience that remains largely "undigitized," smell has been marginalized in our visually dominated, information-driven era. The suppression of non-visual senses and the exclusion of non-dominant communities have created deep epistemic biases. In an ideal world, future AI systems would grow more inclusive — embracing the people, perceptions, memories, and emotions that have long been left outside the arc of technological evolution.</p>

      <h2>Smell Language Game</h2>
      <p>This interactive exercise follows the manifesto's language-game steps: start with the full description, refine sensory details, then compress to a smell-only phrase under 30 tokens. Use the controls below to swap the quiz hint with a condensed smell description.</p>

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>This site is based on research into how different languages and cultures encode smell—from the rich olfactory vocabularies of Southeast Asian communities like the Jahai and Maniq peoples, to the sensory language losing ground in industrialized societies. Explore how smell-based language games can help us recover and preserve these irreplaceable dimensions of human perception.</p>
